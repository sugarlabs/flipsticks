summary   = Using keyframes, program a stick figure to twist and dance
description = Flipsticks is a keyframe animation activity that lets you pose
            and program a stick figure to walk, run, rotate, twist, tumble and
            dance. You can save your animations to the journal and will soon be
            able to share them via the mesh. Flipsticks can be used to explore
            concepts in geometry, computer programming and animation; it helps
            develop spatial and analytical thinking skills.
